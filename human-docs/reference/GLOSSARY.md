# ðŸ“š **Glossary**

## **Technical Terms**

### **API (Application Programming Interface)**
A set of protocols and tools for building software applications. In this project, we integrate with Google Calendar, LinkedIn, OpenAI, and Recall.ai APIs.

### **OAuth 2.0**
An authorization framework that allows applications to access user data without storing passwords. Used for Google and LinkedIn authentication.

### **TypeScript**
A programming language that adds static type definitions to JavaScript. Provides better development experience and fewer runtime errors.

### **Next.js**
A React framework for building web applications. Provides server-side rendering, API routes, and optimized performance.

### **Prisma**
A database toolkit that provides type-safe database access. Used for PostgreSQL database operations.

### **PostgreSQL**
A relational database management system. Stores all application data including users, meetings, and content.

## **Business Terms**

### **Financial Advisor**
A professional who provides financial planning and investment advice to clients. The primary user of this application.

### **FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority)**
A regulatory organization that oversees financial advisors. Compliance with FINRA rules is essential for social media content.

### **SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)**
A federal agency that regulates securities markets. Social media content must comply with SEC regulations.

### **Compliance Validation**
The process of ensuring content meets regulatory requirements before publishing. Includes risk assessment and disclaimer injection.

### **Meeting Transcript**
A written record of a meeting conversation. Generated by Recall.ai bots and used for content generation.

### **Social Media Post**
Content published to social media platforms. Generated by AI and validated for compliance.

## **Application Terms**

### **Recall.ai Bot**
An automated meeting participant that records and transcribes meetings. Managed through the Recall.ai API.

### **Content Generation**
The process of creating social media posts from meeting transcripts using AI (OpenAI GPT-4).

### **Publishing Workflow**
The process of validating content and publishing to social media platforms like LinkedIn.

### **Meeting Management**
The process of scheduling, tracking, and managing meetings and their associated bots.

### **OAuth Token**
A secure token that allows the application to access user data from external services. Stored encrypted in the database.

## **Development Terms**

### **E2E Testing (End-to-End Testing)**
Testing the complete user workflow from start to finish. Uses Playwright to simulate real user interactions.

### **Type Safety**
The practice of using TypeScript to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. Ensures code reliability.

### **Circuit Breaker**
A design pattern that prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services. Used for API resilience.

### **Rate Limiting**
Controlling the rate of requests to external APIs to avoid exceeding quotas and getting blocked.

### **Migration**
A script that changes the database schema. Used to add new fields or tables to the database.

## **Integration Terms**

### **Google Calendar API**
Google's API for accessing calendar data. Used to sync meetings and schedule bots.

### **LinkedIn API**
LinkedIn's API for publishing content. Used to post generated content to LinkedIn.

### **OpenAI API**
OpenAI's API for AI content generation. Used to create social media posts from meeting transcripts.

### **Recall.ai API**
Recall.ai's API for managing meeting bots. Used to schedule and track meeting recordings.

## **Architecture Terms**

### **Master Interfaces**
Centralized TypeScript type definitions in `master-interfaces.ts`. Single source of truth for all types.

### **API Routes**
Next.js API endpoints that handle server-side logic. Located in `src/app/api/`.

### **Database Schema**
The structure of the database including tables, fields, and relationships. Defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

### **Elixir Migration**
The planned transition from Node.js to Elixir/Phoenix for production deployment. Architecture designed for this migration.

### **Phoenix Contexts**
Elixir modules that encapsulate business logic. Will replace Next.js API routes in production.

## **Testing Terms**

### **Playwright**
A testing framework for web applications. Used for E2E testing with real browser automation.

### **Mock Data**
Fake data used for testing when real APIs are not available. Used for development and testing.

### **Real Integrations**
Testing with actual external APIs rather than mocks. Provides more realistic test results.

### **Test Coverage**
The percentage of code covered by tests. Aim for high coverage to ensure reliability.

## **Deployment Terms**

### **Vercel**
A cloud platform for deploying web applications. Recommended for this Next.js application.

### **Environment Variables**
Configuration values stored outside the code. Used for API keys and database connections.

### **Production Environment**
The live environment where the application runs for real users. Separate from development and testing.

### **Health Checks**
Endpoints that verify the application is running correctly. Used for monitoring and alerting.
