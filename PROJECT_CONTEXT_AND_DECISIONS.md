## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS**

### **1. Technology Stack Choice**

**Decision:** Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL
**Rationale:** 
- **Rapid Development**: Next.js provides full-stack capabilities in one framework
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures reliability in a 48-hour sprint
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma for robust data modeling
- **Elixir Migration**: Clear path to Jump's production stack

**Alternative Considered:** Pure React + Express
**Why Rejected:** Would require more setup time and configuration

### **2. Authentication Strategy**

**Decision:** NextAuth.js v4 with multi-provider OAuth
**Rationale:**
- **Multi-Provider**: Google + LinkedIn in single session
- **Security**: Built-in CSRF protection and secure session management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more providers

**Key Insight:** Financial advisors need both Google (calendar) and LinkedIn (publishing) access simultaneously.

### **3. Type System Architecture**

**Decision:** Centralized master-interfaces.ts with 1,994 lines of comprehensive types
**Rationale:**
- **Single Source of Truth**: All types in one place for AI assistance
- **Domain Organization**: Clear separation by business domain
- **Elixir Ready**: Types map 1:1 to Phoenix Contexts
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update and extend

**Key Insight:** AI development requires comprehensive type context for effective assistance.

### **4. External API Integration Strategy**

**Decision:** Real integrations over mocking for core functionality
**Rationale:**
- **Challenge Requirement**: "Real integrations" were explicitly requested
- **Business Value**: Demonstrates actual working solution
- **Risk Management**: Fallback to mock data when APIs fail
- **Type Safety**: 100% type coverage for all external APIs

**Key Insight:** Jump.ai wanted to see real working integrations, not just mockups.

## üß™ **TESTING STRATEGY DECISIONS**

### **1. E2E Testing Approach**

**Decision:** Playwright with real integrations, not mocking
**Rationale:**
- **Challenge Requirement**: "Real integrations" were core to the task
- **Business Value**: Demonstrates actual working solution
- **Risk Management**: Tests real OAuth flows and API calls

**Key Insight:** User explicitly rejected mocking: "we dont want to mock them, since they integrating them is most of this task!"

### **2. Test Organization**

**Decision:** 6 test files with 26 individual tests
**Structure:**
- `basic-page-tests.spec.ts` - Core UI functionality
- `auth-flow-tests.spec.ts` - OAuth flows
- `content-generation-tests.spec.ts` - AI content generation
- `demo-page-tests.spec.ts` - End-to-end workflow
- `error-handling-tests.spec.ts` - Error scenarios
- `real-integration-tests.spec.ts` - Real API integrations

**Key Insight:** Organized by functionality rather than by page for better maintainability.

### **3. Test Execution Strategy**

**Decision:** Sequential execution with Chrome-only focus
**Rationale:**
- **Resource Management**: Avoid API rate limiting
- **Stability**: Sequential execution more reliable
- **Focus**: Chrome-only for faster execution

**Key Insight:** Parallel execution caused resource conflicts and timeouts.

---

## üö® **CRITICAL CHALLENGES OVERCOME**

### **1. GitHub Secret Scanning Violation**

**Problem:** Hardcoded Google OAuth access token in test file
**Solution:** 
- Used `git filter-branch` to remove secret from entire history
- Recreated file with environment variable
- Force pushed cleaned history

**Key Insight:** Security scanning caught hardcoded secrets that could have been a major issue.

### **2. Large Commit Size (9MB)**

**Problem:** Test artifacts (screenshots, videos, reports) in git history
**Solution:**
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude test artifacts
- Used `git rm -r --cached` to remove tracked files
- Re-committed with clean history

**Key Insight:** Test artifacts can quickly bloat repository size.

### **3. E2E Test Stability Issues**

**Problem:** Tests failing due to strict mode violations and timing issues
**Solution:**
- Made locators more specific to avoid strict mode violations
- Added proper error handling and retry logic
- Simplified tests to focus on core functionality

**Key Insight:** Playwright strict mode requires very specific selectors.

### **4. OAuth Flow Complexity**

**Problem:** Multi-provider OAuth with different scopes and requirements
**Solution:**
- Implemented proper scope management for each provider
- Added token refresh logic
- Created unified session management

**Key Insight:** Each OAuth provider has different requirements and limitations.
